# HigherOrLower
A simple game to guess a random number 

A single player game against the AI. The app will generate a random number that the user has to guess. The AI will give the player hints whether the users guess was higher or lower than the answer. 

The app is currently only available for Android devices. The files can be download and opened in Android Studio.

HigherOrLower shows my Java knowledge of working with random numbers and user inputs. Using Toast messages to give the user information and using conditional statements to up date the game state.
